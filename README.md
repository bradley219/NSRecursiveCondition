# NSRecursiveCondition

An objective-C class with identical functionality to the Foundation framework's 
[NSCondition](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/reference/NSCondition_class/Reference/Reference.html) 
class, but with a recursive mutex for locking, effectively combining the functionality of 
[NSCondition](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/reference/NSCondition_class/Reference/Reference.html) 
with [NSRecursiveLock](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/Classes/NSRecursiveLock_Class/Reference/Reference.html).
